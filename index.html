                The examination system begins with a crucial first stage involving the submission of panels by all Heads of Departments (HODs). Each panel includes key roles such as the question paper setter, moderator, examiner, coordinator, scrutinizer, and reviewer, all of whom must be approved by the Board of Studies (BOS). Once the HODs submit these panels to the Controller of Examinations (COE) office, the information is entered into the COE system. This systematic entry allows for efficient organization and tracking of personnel involved in the examination process. Following this, the COE office generates appointment letters for each service provider, ensuring they are officially recognized and informed of their roles. These letters are then dispatched through the COE office's official email, facilitating clear communication and timely updates. This structured approach not only streamlines the preparation for examinations but also enhances accountability and coordination among all involved parties.

                The process of submitting question papers begins as both internal and external setters prepare their
                materials for examinations. These individuals are responsible for creating rigorous and relevant
                questions that align with the curriculum and learning objectives. To streamline the submission process,
                a dedicated email address has been established exclusively for this purpose. This ensures that all
                question papers are centralized in one location, facilitating easy access and organization. By directing
                submissions to a specific email ID, the institution can manage incoming documents more efficiently,
                minimizing the risk of errors or misplaced files. Additionally, this method enhances communication
                between question paper setters and the COE office, allowing for prompt feedback and any necessary
                revisions. Overall, this structured approach contributes to the integrity and quality of the examination

                Moderation is a critical step in finalizing the examination question paper, involving collaboration between internal and external paper setters. This process is initiated only after both sets of questions have been submitted. The moderator, in conjunction with the coordinator, meticulously reviews the submitted questions to ensure they meet academic standards, align with learning objectives, and maintain balance in difficulty. During this review, adjustments may be made to enhance clarity and coherence, ultimately ensuring the quality of the assessment. Once the moderation process is complete, a finalized copy of the question paper, known as the manuscript, is prepared. This manuscript is then securely packaged in a sealed envelope to ensure confidentiality and integrity before being submitted to the Controller of Examinations (COE). This structured approach not only reinforces the reliability of the examination but also ensures that all parties involved uphold the highest academic standards.

Evaluation can commence only after the marking schemes for the subjects have been submitted, ensuring that examiners have clear guidelines for assessing student performance. Examiners can then collect their assigned packets from the front desk, but must first scan the respective packet to ensure accountability and tracking. This process facilitates efficient management and organization of the evaluation materials. Following the evaluation, the same meticulous procedure is applied to scrutinize the packets. This scrutiny step is crucial for verifying the accuracy of the evaluations and ensuring consistency in grading. By adhering to these structured protocols, the examination process maintains a high standard of reliability and fairness, ultimately contributing to the integrity of the assessment results.

                After the publication of results, students are given the opportunity to review their answer papers. This process allows them to gain insights into their performance and address any concerns they may have regarding their evaluations. To initiate a review, students can conveniently apply online, simplifying the application process. They are required to pay a review fee, which covers administrative costs associated with the review procedure. This online application system not only enhances accessibility but also streamlines the review process, making it more efficient for both students and the administration. By offering this opportunity, the institution promotes transparency and encourages students to take an active role in their academic journey, fostering a sense of accountability and engagement in their learning experience.
